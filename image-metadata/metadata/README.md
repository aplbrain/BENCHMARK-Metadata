## Extant schemas examined
* vEM community draft metadata standards
* 3DMMS standard
* Metadata in use by NEMO, BIL, DANDI archives

## Schema Development Process Followed
Comparative analysis, with subsequent integration of metadata fields with two goals:

1. Support for all currently-employed modalities and likely future modalities.
2. Provide for ease of building/supporting bidirectional conversions between the new metadata schema and common extant schemas
