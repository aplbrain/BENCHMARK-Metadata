# v1.1 Image and Experimental Metadata Standards for EM and XRM Connectomics Community
In this folder, you will find
* The v1.1 metadata description: [schema](imaging-metadata.plantuml), [diagram](imaging-metadata.png), [description](imaging-metadata.md)
* Reference material comparing the proposed draft to related standards efforts: [standards-development](standards-development)

## Extant schemas examined
* vEM community draft metadata standards
* 3DMMS standard
* Metadata in use by NEMO, BIL, DANDI archives (including NWB, BIDS, and Standard Metadata for 3D Microscopy)

## Schema Development Process Followed
Comparative analysis, with subsequent integration of metadata fields with two goals:

1. Support for all currently-employed modalities and likely future modalities.
2. Provide for ease of building/supporting bidirectional conversions between the new metadata schema and common extant schemas
