# BossDB-Metadata
Preliminary draft metadata specification for Images, Experiments, and Annotations related to EM and XRM Connectomics experiments.

In the folder image-metadata, you will see draft standards for image and experimental metadata for review. Standards will be evolving based on our working group meetings and will be developed with versioned releases.
* [Images](image-metadata/images)
* [Image and Experimental Metadata](image-metadata/metadata)
* [Annotation Metadata](annotation-metadata)

# Contributing
We welcome comments and feedback on these draft standards through three methods:

1. Join us for general discussion on Github- this is a great place for comments, questions, references, and suggestions. You can open a new thread or comment on an existing thread: https://github.com/aplbrain/BENCHMARK-Metadata/discussions
2. Post an issue if you have a specific comment on the content of one of the files in the repository
3. Create a fork and issue a pull request for review if you have significant changes to more than one file

# Standards Development
This standards development process is an ongoing collaboration between our BENCHMARK team, the BossDB archive, and our community working group. We thank everyone for their contributions!
